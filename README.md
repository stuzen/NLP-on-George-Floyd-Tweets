## "My argument was not that what happens on that social media website is broadly representative of popular opinion but that what happens on Twitter is a good barometer of enthusiasm around movement-building and fandoms."-Charlie Warzel-New York Times

Amidst the tumultuous events unfolding globally—Covid-19, economic upheaval, and the George Floyd protests—I found myself particularly drawn to the Black Lives Matter movement and its rapid dissemination both domestically and internationally. Twitter emerged as a pivotal platform in shaping the discourse. As chaos gripped the nation, I pondered whether discernible patterns could be gleaned from the tweets surrounding the George Floyd incident. Could the sentiments expressed on Twitter offer insight into public opinion? What prevailing ideologies dominated discussions? Driven by curiosity, I sifted through the most popular tweets from June 1st to June 9th, 2020, containing the keyword "Floyd." Employing various NLP techniques such as Bag of Words, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, and Named Entity Recognition, I delved into the data.
