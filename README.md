## "My argument was not that what happens on that social media website is broadly representative of popular opinion but that what happens on Twitter is a good barometer of enthusiasm around movement-building and fandoms."-Charlie Warzel-New York Times

There are crazy things happening all around the world: Covid-19, shattered economies, George Floyd protests... I was especially interested in the blacklives matter movement and how it spread across the country and abroad in a very short time. The role Twitter played was significant. The whole country was in turmoil. While all this happening, I was wondering if I could find any pattern in the tweets about the George Floyd incident. Could I find out the standing of public on the issue by analyzing tweets? What are the most popular ideologies about the incident? Curiously, I pulled the most popular tweets posted between 06-01-2020 and 06-09-2020 that include the word "Floyd" in it. I applied some NLP strategies such as Bag of Words, Term Frequency-Inverse Document frequency, and Name Entity Recognition methods.

The steps are;

1. Importing NLP Modules 
2. Accessing Twitter API 
3. Scraping Tweets
4. Cleaning tweets
5. Sentiment Analysis
* Bag of Words
* Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
* Polarity-Subjectivity Scores
